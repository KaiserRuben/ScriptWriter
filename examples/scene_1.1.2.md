## Scene 1.1.2: USS HORIZON - BRIDGE - MORNING

The bridge of the USS Horizon hums with anticipation. Holographic displays flicker with data streams, casting an ethereal glow over the assembled crew. CAPTAIN ELARA VENN strides in, her presence immediately commanding attention.

CAPTAIN ELARA VENN
Status report.

COMMANDER ZAX steps forward, their alien features impassive.

COMMANDER ZAX
We've reached the coordinates, Captain. The anomaly is directly ahead, but our sensors are... struggling to make sense of it.

Captain Venn nods, her eyes scanning the main viewscreen. A swirling mass of colors and distortions fills the display, seeming to shift and change even as they watch.

CAPTAIN ELARA VENN
Lt. Commander Imam, your analysis?

LT. COMMANDER DR. SAIRA IMAM looks up from her console, her eyes bright with a mix of excitement and concern. She steals a quick glance at Captain Venn before responding.

LT. COMMANDER DR. SAIRA IMAM
Captain, the anomaly appears to be emitting waves of... something. Not quite energy, not quite matter. It's unlike anything we've ever encountered. I'd like to launch a series of probes to gather more data.

Captain Venn considers this, her brow furrowing slightly. For a moment, the bridge seems to waver around her, but she blinks and it stabilizes.

CAPTAIN ELARA VENN
Proceed with caution, Doctor. I want a full analysis of any potential risks before we commit to further action.

Saira nods, her admiration for the captain's measured approach evident in her expression.

LT. COMMANDER DR. SAIRA IMAM
Of course, Captain. I'll coordinate with Engineering to ensure the probes are properly shielded.

LT. KIRO VASH speaks up from the tactical station, his voice tinged with concern.

LT. KIRO VASH
Captain, I recommend we raise shields. That... thing out there is giving me a bad feeling.

Captain Venn turns to Vash, her expression softening slightly.

CAPTAIN ELARA VENN
Your concerns are noted, Lieutenant. Let's not jump to conclusions, but stay alert. Maintain yellow alert status for now.

Vash nods, not entirely satisfied but respecting the captain's decision. Captain Venn turns back to the main viewscreen, her voice taking on a more authoritative tone.

CAPTAIN ELARA VENN
This is what we're out here for, people. To push the boundaries of knowledge, to explore the unknown. But we do it carefully, methodically. Let's make Starfleet proud.

The crew responds with a mix of 'Aye, Captain' and nods of agreement. As they turn back to their stations, Captain Venn's gaze lingers on the swirling anomaly. For a split second, she sees faces forming in the chaotic patterns, their expressions twisted in agony. She blinks hard, and the vision vanishes.

CAPTAIN ELARA VENN
(quietly, to herself) What are you?

The anomaly pulses on the viewscreen, as if in response to her whispered question. The bridge lights flicker almost imperceptibly, casting momentary shadows that seem to dance at the edge of perception.
