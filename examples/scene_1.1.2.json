        "justification": "Hints at deeper themes are present: the allure and danger of the unknown, the responsibility of scientific exploration, and potentially the psychological impact of encountering something truly alien. The brief vision Captain Venn experiences adds intrigue and foreshadows potential psychological horror elements.",

      "story_consistency": {
        "justification": "The scene aligns well with established tropes of psychological sci-fi thrillers: unknown anomaly, cautious explorers, potential for psychic/psychological effects. The brief moment of instability experienced by Captain Venn sets the stage for potentially unsettling encounters.",

    "feedback": "Areas for Improvement:\n\n* **Dialogue Nuance:** While functional, the dialogue could benefit from subtext and subtle character interactions. Explore underlying tensions or unspoken concerns to add depth.\n* **Sensory Detail:** Enhance the atmosphere by incorporating more sensory details beyond sight. How does the anomaly sound? What is the tactile sensation of being near it?\n* **Captain Venn's Vision:**  Expand upon this intriguing moment. What emotions did she feel during the vision? Was it a premonition, a psychic intrusion, or something else entirely? This could be a key element for future plot development."
